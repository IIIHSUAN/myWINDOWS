Designed and developed a distinctive C++ GUI system using a simulator approach, ensuring a modern and intuitive desktop experience within a terminal display. Key features include:
 - Implemented robust multithreading, event queue for dispatching, and handling.
 - Utilization of the browser core and JavaScript Engine concept for optimized management of DOM elements (e.g., div, span, input, image) and the layout tree rendering process. This supports partial CSS syntax (e.g., position, width, padding, z-index, transition) and real-time animations.
 - Established a secure container environment, API collaborations, and supporting services for applications.
