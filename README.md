# C++ ASCII Browser Engine

By using C++ std library and Windows API to implement a modern-browser-like application that can be run in a terminal. One of the purposes of this project is to approach windowing system development and conform to OOP and modern software module design criteria for generating clean code. Be able to run JavaScript in a virtual environment, support some of the useful browser API so it works well with custom JavaScript code, and can process the web page seamlessly. Considering .NET winform and browser engine design logic, the goal is to be dedicated to developing a similar software architecture. Feature with DOM implementation, rendering pipeline, element on event callback, css attribute and animation, JavaScript event loop and more.
