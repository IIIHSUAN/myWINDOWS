Try to use your mouse to operate a GUI system on a terminal screen that comprises characters as "window", and also be able to interact with applications and play games. What about browsing the latest web pages, chatting online, and even watching streams? It is all set on a single terminal. Just like any other modern browsers do but in an old-fashioned retro-computer way. Doesn't that seem to be a bit weird, but also a bit challenging and exotic?

By means of the OOP, command line system interface and GUI concepts, develop a graphical display system using a terminal as the output. Inspired by .NET, Winform and browser core concepts, here I've implemented simple HTML rendering and JavaScript engine logic in the core of the system. In the future, I plan to simulate and implement micro-kernel system services, container sandbox environments, and the browser application running on this system.

如果能在黑底白字的終端機畫面中使用滑鼠操作由文字方塊組成的視窗「圖案」，在其中與應用程式互動、遊玩小遊戲，甚至是瀏覽最新網頁、線上互動聊天、觀賞串流影片呢? 與其他現代瀏覽器操作方式和邏輯無異，只在於它看似 80 年代的電腦畫面輸出。聽起來有些詭異，但或許是個新奇有趣的想法?

以物件導向、命令列系統介面和 GUI 概念開發的以黑底白字的終端機作為輸出介面的圖形化系統。並從「瀏覽器核心」、「.NET」及「Winform」中獲得架構開發靈感，在核心中有參考 HTML 渲染和 JavaScript 引擎概念的實作。未來並規劃在底層上實作模擬微核心系統服務、容器虛擬環境和其上可運行的瀏覽器應用程式。
